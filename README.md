## Bio
Hi, I'm Prabesh.<br>I did some Physics for my undergrad degree (2017), and then got into coding/software for a bit, and in 2019/2020 I'll be doing an MSc in Computer Science (hopefully specialising in Machine Learning).<br>Over the next year or so, I'll try to write interesting essays about new topics I've read about. Maybe I can come up with an interesting bunch of questions to explore further. 
## Interests
*Decision-making under risk and uncertainty.*<br>
`1` Quantifying metrics - Probability Theory, Information Theory<br>
`2` Algorithmic decision-making - Machine Learning<br>
`3` Applications - Quant trading, Epidemiology + Medical Statistics<br>
`4` Misapplications of knowledge - Misuses of statistics, Iatrogenesis (Modern diet 'science', 'Bad Pharma')<br>
`5` Policy decisions - Austrian Economics, Localism, avoiding naive interventions, ...etc<br>
`6` How we process uncertainty - Neuroscience (esp. Hemispheric specialisation), Psychology (e.g. fear as risk-management circuitry)<br>
`7` Reduction of uncertainty - Karl Popper + falsifiable theories, the value of knowing what *not* to do.<br>
`8` Complexity science<br>

## Contents (to eventually fill in...)
- Essays
- Jupyter & Mathematica Notebooks

## Authors, Books and Websites list
* (This is kind of a to-do list - to remind myself what topics I could write about...) *
