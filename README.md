## Interests
The central idea that I'm curious about: ***Decision-making under uncertainty.***<br>

* **Quantitative methods** - <br>
Probability Theory<br>
Information Theory<br>
Machine Learning<br>
Complexity Science<br>
* **Areas of application** - Quant Trading, Epidemiology + Medical Statistics + Bioinformatics <br>
* **Misapplications** - Iatrogenesis (Modern diet 'science', 'Bad Pharma'), naive policy decisions<br>
* **Reduction of Risk & Uncertainty** - The value of knowing what *not* to do, risk-management, 'traditional wisdom' .<br>
* **Neuroscience** - <br>
Hemispheric specialisation (Novelty-routinization). <br>
Instinct as evolutionary risk-management. <br>
Dopamine and its link to uncertainty + exploration. <br>
* **'Contrarian' careers** - <br>
Exploration of uncertain economic/scientific territory, usually where very few people agree on the value of an opportunity. e.g. Research, Startups, Hedge Funds. <br> *If they all agreed with you, the opportunity would already be taken.*
* **Philosophy** - <br>
Courage: the willing exploration of risk + uncertainty. <br>
Wisdom: the management/constraint of risk + uncertainty. <br>
