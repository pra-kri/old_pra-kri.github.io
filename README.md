# Interests
The central idea that I'm curious about: <br>
***Decision-making under uncertainty. How should you act in the face of the unknown?***<br>

* **Quantitative Methods** - *Quantitative tools to deal with uncertainty*
    * Probability Theory
    * Information Theory
    * Machine Learning
    * Complexity
* **Areas of Application** - *Fields where uncertainty plays a large role.*
    * Quant. Trading
    * Epidemiology, Medical Statistics
    * Data Science
* **Misapplications** - *How to deal with uncertainty like an idiot.*
    * Iatrogenesis (modern diet 'science')
    * Lying with statistics ('Bad Pharma')
    * Naive policy decisions
* **Uncertainty + Risk Reduction** - *Avoiding/ignoring things to reduce uncertainty.*
    * Risk Management: knowing what to avoid.
    * Signal vs. Noise: 80/20, knowing what to ignore.
* **Neuroscience** - *How the brain deals with uncertainty.*
    * Hemispheric specialization - dealing with novelty + uncertainty.
    * Dopamine - exploration, reinforcement learning under uncertainty.
* **History, Mythology, Ethics, Literature** - *Behavioural approaches to dealing with uncertainty.*
    * Exploration of the unknown - *Maps of Meaning*, *The Hero With a Thousand Faces*
    * Culture and Tradition - as historically embedded knowledge/risk-management.
    * Ethics - '*sin of omission*', potential + risk (regarding uncertain outcomes)
* **'Contrarian' Careers** - *Disagreeing with the consensus.*
    * Exploration of uncertain economic/scientific territory, usually where very few people agree on the value of an opportunity.
    * e.g. Research, Startups, Hedge Funds
    * *If they all agreed with you, the opportunity would already be taken*.
