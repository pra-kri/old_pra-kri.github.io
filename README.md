## Bio
Hi, I'm Prabesh. I did some Physics for my undergrad degree (2017), and then got into coding/software for a bit, and in 2019/2020 I'll be doing an MSc in Computer Science (hopefully specialising in Machine Learning). Over the next year or so, I'll try to write interesting essays about new topics I've learnt. Maybe I can come up with an interesting bunch of questions to explore further. 
## Interests
*Decision-making under risk and uncertainty.*
`1` Quantifying metrics - Probability Theory, Information Theory
`2` Algorithmic decision-making - Machine Learning
`3` Applications - Quant trading, Epidemiology + Medical Statistics
`4` Misapplications of knowledge - Misuses of statistics, Iatrogenics, Modern diet 'science', 'Bad Pharma'
`5` Policy decisions - Austrian Economics, Localism, avoiding naive interventions, ...etc
`6` How we process uncertainty - Neuroscience (esp. Hemispheric specialisation), Psychology (e.g. fear as risk-management circuitry)
`7` Reduction of uncertainty - Karl Popper + falsifiable theories,
`8` Complexity science
