## About
Two years ago, while I was *supposed* to be studying for my final exams for my undergrad Physics degree, <br>
I spent hours and hours a day reading books and papers and watching lectures - on everything **except** Physics.<br>
To me, reading up on Neuroscience and its link to our day-to-day experiences was much more interesting than Quantum Mechanics. <br>
The way statistics and probability theory are used in decision-making and risk-taking was much more <br>
captivating than studying how a bunch of electrons float around and avoid each other as if they all owed each other money.<br>
I thought, *why follow the syllabus when instead you can follow your own curiosity?*
<br>
This site contains my essays, code and notes regarding all those interesting things I learn about.  <br>
<br>
At the most basic level, this is a way for me to show off all the stuff that I've worked on and thought about. <br>
That way, maybe I could use this portfolio to get into positions involving research, writing and decision-making. <br>
<br>
More importantly, putting material online is a way for me to put a small amount of 'skin in the game'. <br>
A badly written essay or notebook might just come back to bite me, reputationally or otherwise. <br>
<br>

## Interests
The central idea that I'm curious about: *How to behave under risk, uncertainty and chaos.*<br>
* Areas of application - Quant Trading, Epidemiology + Medical Statistics + Bioinformatics, Data Science <br>
* Quantitative metrics - Probability Theory, Information Theory<br>
* Algorithmic methods - Machine Learning, Computational Statistics<br>
* Misapplications - Iatrogenesis (Modern diet 'science', 'Bad Pharma'), naive policy decisions<br>
* Neuroscience - Hemispheric specialisation (Novelty-routinization). <br>
                 Instinct as evolutionary risk-management circuitry. <br>
                 Dopamine and its link to uncertainty + exploration. <br>
* Reduction of Uncertainty - The value of knowing what *not* to do, risk-management, 'traditional wisdom' .<br>
* Complexity Science - unpredictable behaviour of aggregate large-scale systems not seen in individuals.
* Strategy - how best to handle uncertainty + changing circumstances in the environment.
* 'Contrarian' careers - Exploration of uncertain economic/scientific territory, usually where very few people agree <br>
                         on the value of an opportunity. e.g. Research, Startups, Hedge Funds.<br>
                         If they all agreed with you, the opportunity would already be taken.
* Philosophy - Courage: the willing exploration of risk + uncertainty. <br>
               Wisdom: the management and constraint of risk + uncertainty. <br>
               Epistemology: *clearly this Prabesh guy has no f\*\*\*ing clue what he's talking about*
