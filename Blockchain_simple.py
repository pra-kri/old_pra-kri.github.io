# basically --> implement a database that is distributed across many computers, with a set of rules for verifying new additions to the database.


# to start with, just make a distributed database for 2 people.



import hashlib
import json
import sys
import random


# first, need wrap out hashing algorithm with a helper function

def hashMe(msg = ''):
	if type(msg) != str:
		msg = json.dumps(msg, sort_keys = True)

	return hashlib.sha256(str(msg).encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()


random.seed(0)


def makeTransaction(maxValue=10):
	# will generate random transcations of size between 0 and maxValue

	sign = int(random.getrandbits(1))*2 - 1
	# randomly generates an integer with 1 bit. (so either 1 or 0)
	# then multiple by 2 and subtract 1, to generate either -1 or +1.


	amount = random.randint(1, maxValue)

	APays = sign*amount
	BPays = (-1)*APays
	# 2 people transaction, person A and person B



	return {u'A':APays, u'B':BPays}
	# where {} is a SET. 
	# and the u just before the string A - e.g. u'A' - means that a UNICODE string is created.


# Now, make a crap-tonne of transactions.

txnBuffer = []
for i in range(0,75):
	txnBuffer.append(makeTransaction())


#txnBuffer = [makeTransaction() for i in range(0,5)]
# also, just use list comprehensions
# txnBuffer = transaction buffer


# Now, need to make actual Blocks.
# For this, need to define a set of simple rules.

# Rule 1 - sum of transaction between A, B must  = 0
# Rule 2 - A,B accounts must have money in them ($>0)

# Transaction should only pass if Rule 1,2 are both valid.

	# state = state of A,B accounts

	# if txn is VALID, then you implement updateState.

	state = state.copy()


	for key in txn:
		if key in state.keys():
			state[key] += txn[key]
			# add to state, if key is already present

        else:
            return True
    




#print(isValidTxn({u'A': -3, u'B': 3},state))
# this will come out as True.
# for A: 5 - 3 > 0. All good.
# for B: 5 + 3 > 0. All good.
# Both Rule 1 and Rule 2 are satisfied.

#print(isValidTxn({u'A': -1, u'B': 3},state))
# False, because the transaction doesnt balance to 0. Rule 1 broken.

#print(isValidTxn({u'A': -7, u'B': 7},state))
# False, because A doesnt have Â£7 to take out. Rule 2 broken.


# Now, need to implement BLOCKs.
# Each block has:
# 	- a batch of txns
#	- a reference to the HASH of the previous block.
# 	- and a hash of its own contents, and the header.


# 'genesis block' = first block of the chain. This doesnt have a previous block, so it will not reference the HASH of any other blocks.

# the functions dont recognise the dictionary 'state'
# instead, you have to write state12.
# i think its because the input to the function cant be the same name as what it is referred to.
